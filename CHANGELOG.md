# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `audit_schema_version` field at the top level of every audit record
  (currently `2`).
- Built-in bioio readers are now first-class `ReaderPlugin` instances
  registered via the new `zarrmony.readers.plugin` registry. `convert()` and
  `inspect()` dispatch through `plugin.get_reader()`, returning
  `(reader, plugin, match_score)`.

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** the audit record's `reader_plugin` is now a nested dict with
  `name`, `version`, `source`, `distribution`, and `match_score`. The flat
  `reader_plugin: str` and `reader_plugin_version: str | None` top-level
  fields are removed.
- **BREAKING:** `inspect()` returns a nested `reader_plugin` dict (same shape
  as the audit record) instead of a flat `plugin: str` field.
- `audit.build_audit_record()` signature: `reader_plugin` now takes a
  `ReaderPlugin | None`; new keyword args `match_score` and `distribution`
  (the latter overrides the plugin's static `distribution` so the catch-all
  default plugin can surface the actual bioio sub-package, e.g.
  `bioio-ome-tiff`).
- The CZI, LIF, and ND2 built-in readers are now `ReaderPlugin` instances
  (`czi_plugin`, `lif_plugin`, `nd2_plugin`) registered through the new
  registry alongside `default_plugin`. They live next to `default.py` at
  `zarrmony/readers/{czi,lif,nd2}.py` (the `readers/overrides/` subpackage
  is gone).

### Removed

- **BREAKING:** `zarrmony.readers._OVERRIDES`, `register_override()`,
  `ReaderFactory`, and the legacy 2-tuple `zarrmony.readers.get_reader()`
  are gone. There is now exactly one way for a reader to exist in zarrmony:
  register a `ReaderPlugin` via `zarrmony.readers.plugin.register_plugin()`
  (or expose one through the `zarrmony.readers` entry-point group). Callers
  should import `get_reader` from `zarrmony.readers.plugin`.
- **BREAKING:** the legacy 2-tuple `open_default_reader`,
  `open_czi_reader`, `open_lif_reader`, `open_nd2_reader` factory functions
  are removed. Use the corresponding `*_plugin` instances (or call them
  directly as `plugin.open(path)`) instead.
- **BREAKING:** the `zarrmony.readers.overrides` subpackage is removed;
  imports of `zarrmony.readers.overrides.{czi,lif,nd2}` should move to
  `zarrmony.readers.{czi,lif,nd2}`.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-05-07

### Added

- Initial package scaffolding (`src/zarrmony/` layout, ruff, pre-commit, CI on Ubuntu + macOS).
- Apache-2.0 license.
- PyPI release workflow (trusted publishing via OIDC).
- `--layout {per-scene,bf2raw}` option on `zarrmony convert` (and a matching
  `layout=` argument on `convert()`).
- `zarrmony.naming.sanitize_scene_name` and `resolve_scene_dirnames` for
  filesystem-safe per-scene store directory names with collision fallback.

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** `convert()`'s default output layout flipped from
  `bioformats2raw.layout` to **per-scene**. By default, `output` is now treated
  as a directory and one self-describing `<sanitized_scene_name>.ome.zarr`
  store is written per scene. The bundled `bioformats2raw.layout` shape
  remains available via `layout="bf2raw"` (`--layout bf2raw`).
- **BREAKING:** `convert()`'s return shape in the new default layout is
  `{"input": ..., "output": ..., "layout": "per-scene", "stores": [<per-store
  audit>, ...]}`. `layout="bf2raw"` continues to return the single bundle's
  audit dict.
- In per-scene mode, `force` / `--force` is checked per output store: a
  pre-existing sibling store under the output directory is left untouched
  unless it collides with a scene being written.
