## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.4] - 2026-05-07

### Added

- Initial package scaffolding (`src/zarrmony/` layout, ruff, pre-commit, CI on Ubuntu + macOS).
- Apache-2.0 license.
- PyPI release workflow (trusted publishing via OIDC).
- `--layout {per-scene,bf2raw}` option on `zarrmony convert` (and a matching
  `layout=` argument on `convert()`).
- `zarrmony.naming.sanitize_scene_name` and `resolve_scene_dirnames` for
  filesystem-safe per-scene store directory names with collision fallback.

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** `convert()`'s default output layout flipped from
  `bioformats2raw.layout` to **per-scene**. By default, `output` is now treated
  as a directory and one self-describing `<sanitized_scene_name>.ome.zarr`
  store is written per scene. The bundled `bioformats2raw.layout` shape
  remains available via `layout="bf2raw"` (`--layout bf2raw`).
- **BREAKING:** `convert()`'s return shape in the new default layout is
  `{"input": ..., "output": ..., "layout": "per-scene", "stores": [<per-store
  audit>, ...]}`. `layout="bf2raw"` continues to return the single bundle's
  audit dict.
- In per-scene mode, `force` / `--force` is checked per output store: a
  pre-existing sibling store under the output directory is left untouched
  unless it collides with a scene being written.
